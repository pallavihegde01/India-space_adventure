It was in the Sun's orbit for 7 years. The scientific payloads cover the Visible (3500–6000 Å...), UV (1300–op Å...), soft and hard X-ray regimes (0.5–8 keV; 3–80 keV). The uniqueness of ASTROSAT lies in its wide spectral coverage extending over visible, UV, soft and hard X-ray regions.</p><br>

It played a significant role in advancing India's space program and conducting scientific experiments.Aryabhata was launched into space on April 19, 1997. It was named after the great Indian astronomer and was built entirely in India. This ground-breaking satellite enthralled the world.Aryabhata was sent into orbit by the powerful Kosmos-3M launch vehicle from Kapustin Yar, a well-known Soviet rocket launch complex in Astrakhan Oblast. It embarked on a journey to unravel the mysteries of our planet and beyond with precision and grace.Aryabhata weighed 794 pounds (360 kg) and was outfitted with innovative technology. Its aim is to probe deep into the Earth's ionosphere, meticulously analyzing the interesting neutrons and gamma rays emitted by our bright sun. Aryabhata was also programmed to discover the secrets of the universe through enthralling X-ray astronomy experiments.On the historic day of April 19, 1975, Aryabhata took flight, riding atop a Russian-made rocket within the Soviet Union's borders. Aryabhata exemplifies India's capability in space exploration.</p>

It was successfully launched onboard SLV-3 from SHAR Centre on July 18, 1980 into an orbit of 305 x 919 km with an inclination of 44.7°. All the fourth stage parameters of SLV-3 were successfully telemetered to the ground stations by RS-1 during the launch phase. The satellite had an orbital life of 9 months. The satellite carried Digital sun sensor, Magnetometer and temperature sensors. The structure was made of Aluminium Alloy.</p>

The Vikas engine is a powerful and reliable liquid rocket engine developed by the Indian Space Research  Organization (ISRO). It has been extensively used in various launch vehicles, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).The series of liquid-fueled rocket engines developed by ISRO scientists have redefined the possibilities for space exploration. A brilliant team at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Center, led by the extraordinary Nambi Narayanan, developed the Vikas engine in the 1970s.This marvel of Indian engineering has risen to tremendous heights by drawing inspiration from the licensed version of the Viking engine and combining it with an innovative chemical pressurization system.It also powers the PSLV's second stage, boosts the performance of the GSLV Mark I and II, and serves as the fearsome core stage of the GSLV Mark III. This remarkable engine has carried missions such as Chandrayan and Mangalyaan to the stars.On January 30, 2023, ISRO reached a watershed moment: the Vikas engine's initial throttling trial hot test was a success. Witness the engineering marvel's accuracy and refinement as ISRO achieved a historic 67% power reduction for a stunning 43 seconds.</p>

MOM, blasted into space by the powerful PSLV-XL, set out on its voyage to Mars.Since it first arrived at Mars on September 24, 2014, MOM has been in orbit around the planet. Its strategic orientation lets it gather detailed photographs of a whole Martian hemisphere simultaneously, thanks to a highly elliptical orbit spanning 423 80,000 km.MOM carries a color camera, a thermal infrared sensor, an ultraviolet spectrometer, a mass spectrometer, and a methane sensor, among other instruments that allow scientists to examine the Martian exosphere and investigate the existence of methane.Notably, on October 19, 2014, MOM had the unusual opportunity to view Comet Siding Spring as it gently glided by Mars, approaching 132,000 miles from the planet.</p>

            <h3><b>Chandrayan 3-2023</b></h3>
            <p><img class="igm" src="src/images/chand3.jpeg" alt="Chandrayan 3-2023" style="width:350px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;">On August 23, 2023, ISRO achieved a significant milestone with the successful launch of Chandrayaan-3. It was launched using LVM3, weighing 8,400 kilograms. This spacecraft is on course to touch down on the Moon's surface by September 7, 2023. Chandrayaan-3's primary mission objective is the soft landing of a rover on the lunar surface, facilitating a series of experiments aimed at comprehending both the Moon's surface and subsurface characteristics. The spacecraft has been outfitted with a laser altimeter, a spectrometer, and a magnetometer, among other instruments. Noteworthy features of Chandrayaan-3 include its three-part configuration, comprising a lander, a rover, and a propulsion module. The Vikram lander is poised to execute a gentle landing in the South Pole region of the Moon, while the subsequent deployment of the Pragyan rover will initiate an exploration phase lasting up to 14 days. Remarkably, this ambitious mission operates within a budget of approximately 615 crores, a testament to ISRO's efficient resource management and strategic allocation of funds. <br><br><br><br> </p>

            <p class="ancie">India`s ancient Astronomers Aryabhatta (476-550 A.D), Varahamihira (505-587 A.D), Brahmagupta (598-668 A.D), Bhaskara-1 (600-680.A.D), and Bhaskara-2 (1114-1185 A.D) have been credited with postulating certain fundamental principles of Astronomy including the helio-centric concept of rotation of Earth around the Sun, prediction of lunar and solar eclipse, concept of gravitational force and mathematics of planetary motion.These principles are fundamental in nature and form an important step in the advancement of Astronomy and contribute to our understanding of the Modern Astronomy and the methods of Celestial Mechanics that are used in the Space Programme.</p>

            <p class="moderno">It may surprise some of you to know that ISRO was actually formed way back in 1962. The Indian National Committee for Space Research, as it was then called, was formed under the leadership of Vikram Sarabhai and physicist Kalpathi Ramakrishna Ramanathan.The Nike-Apache rocket supplied by NASA, being brought to Thumba for assemblyAt the time they had no resources to speak of, a small pool of scientists, and barely any funding. In fact, for the first rocket they launched a year later, they were transporting the parts to be assembled by bicycle. And now, more than 50 years later, we're launching rockets to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. <br>So here are some of the greatest milestones in ISRO's history.</p>
